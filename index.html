        Formula One, commonly abbreviated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"
            target="_blank"><b>F1</b></a>, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel
        single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile"
            target="_blank"><b>Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)</b></a>. The
        FIA
        Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural
        running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_regulations" target="_blank"><b>set of rules</b></a> all
        participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known
        as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_Grands_Prix" target="_blank"><b>Grand
                Prix.</b></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_circuits" target="_blank"><b>circuits</b></a> or
        closed roads.A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions" target="_blank"><b>one
                for the
                drivers</b></a> , and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions"
            target="_blank"><b>one for the constructors</b></a> —now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a
        valid Super Licence,
        the highest class
        of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the
        FIA issues for tracks.<br />

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_car" target="_blank"><b>Formula One cars</b></a> are the
        world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds
        achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear
        wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics" target="_blank"><b>aerodynamics</b></a>, <a

        Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in
        1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008,
        respectively.<br />

        With the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at
        approximately £220 million, Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula
        One Group is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Media" target="_blank"><b>Liberty
                Media</b></a>, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVC_Capital_Partners" target="_blank"><b>CVC Capital Partners</b></a>
        for
        US$8 billion.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Jr." target="_blank"><b>Carlos Sainz Vázquez de
                Castro</b></a> ; (born 1 September 1994) is a Spanish racing driver, who is contracted to compete
        in Formula One for Williams. Sainz has won four Formula One Grands Prix across 10 seasons.

        Born in Madrid, Sainz is the son of two-time World Rally Champion Carlos Sainz. Graduating from karting to
        junior formulae in 2010, Sainz won his first championship at the Formula <b>Renault NEC</b> in 2011 with
        Koiranen,
        finishing runner-up to Robin Frijns in the Eurocup that year. In 2012, Sainz contested British Formula 3, the
        Formula 3 Euro Series and FIA European Formula 3 with Carlin. Sainz progressed to the GP3 Series with Arden in
        2013, finishing tenth in his rookie season. He then found success in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, winning the
        championship in 2014 with DAMS.
    </p>

    <p> A member of the <b>Red Bull Junior</b> Team since 2010, Sainz signed with <b>Toro Rosso</b> in 2015, debuting
        alongside <b>Max Verstappen</b>
        . He remained at Toro Rosso until the 2017 United States Grand Prix, where he replaced Jolyon Palmer
        at Renault, having already signed with the team from 2018 onwards. Sainz moved to <b>McLaren</b> in 2019, ending
        his
        association with Red Bull. He took his maiden podium at the Brazilian Grand Prix that year, followed by another
        at the Italian Grand Prix in 2020. Sainz signed for <b>Ferrari</b> in 2021, replacing Sebastian Vettel to
        partner
        Charles Leclerc. After a winless debut season for Ferrari, Sainz took his maiden pole position and win at the
        British Grand Prix in 2022. He took further wins for Ferrari at Singapore in 2023, as well as Australia and
        Mexico City in 2024. Replaced by Lewis Hamilton for 2025, Sainz joined <b>Williams</b> to partner Alexander
        Albon.
    </p>

    <p>As of the 2024 <b>Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</b>, Sainz has achieved four race wins, six pole positions, four fastest
        laps
        and 27 podiums in Formula One. Sainz is contracted to remain at Williams until at least the end of the 2026
        season.</p>
    <p>
        Carlos Sainz was born on 1 September 1994 in Madrid, Spain, to father Carlos Sainz and his
        wife Reyes Vázquez de Castro. His father is a rally driver, who won the World Rally Championship twice in 1990
        and 1992, with 26 rally victories. Eventually, as Sainz Jr. got older, his father mentored him throughout his
        journey which led to him getting in to F1 racing.
